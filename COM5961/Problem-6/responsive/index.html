                        <h5>Thanks to the Internet! I can now easily access information and knowledge at my finger tips without leaving the comfort of my home. </h5>
                        As I have benefited tremendously from the generous sharing of knowhow by authors on Github, YouTube, Medium, and the like, it’s time for me to give back. I would like to be a self-ordained curator, sharing my views on what’s happening out there in the tech and startup world, built upon contributions already made by others.
                        At the same time, I combine my blogs with my official and unofficial courses so as to have a single point of presence on the web for doing my job.
